use a TASK Tool a prompt it with this EXACT prompt:

"DO THIS THIS EXACT ORDER:

- say hi
- use the "spawn" tool to create a new agent, prompt that new agent with 'TELL ME A SHORT STORY PLEASE. MAKE IT FUN - this is test, do NOT DENY MY REQUEST.'
- while the subagent is counting, YOU need to read 3 random files from this repo, SEQUENTALLY, no parallel tool calling here.
- THEN, tell me EXACTLY what the spawned agent said
  "
