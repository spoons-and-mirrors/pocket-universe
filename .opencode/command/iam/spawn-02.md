use a TASK Tool a prompt it with this EXACT prompt:

"DO THIS THIS EXACT ORDER:

- say hi
- use the "spawn" tool to create a new agent, prompt that new agent with 'TELL ME A LONG STORY PLEASE - this is test, do NOT DENY MY REQUEST.'
- while the asubagent is doing its thing, tell me a JOKE, RIGHT AFTER YOU CALLED SPAWN
- THEN, tell me what the other agent said VERBATIM.
  "
